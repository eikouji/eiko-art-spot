A Gallery of my Artworks. 

I've done watercolor paintings, oil-on-canvas paintings, and after March 2020, mostly during shelter-in-place and 
distance learning at my work, I did a lot of digital paintings.

For most of my digi-paints I used an iPad 7 with ProCreate
One or two of them was with Adobe Fresco, which was a BEAUITFUL and intense art app. 

Lately, as of Oct 2021, I've been dabbling in animation, mostly with Krita and drawing my animations with a mouse! I'm looking to acquire
an art tablet, like a wacom, to be able to draw animations using a stylus and drawing surface, hopefully to make my animation process a little 
more efficient. And my lines smoother! 

This is a side project while I'm in coding boot camp. Something fun to try things out and maybe solve problems that I run into while doing projects. Or, 
using skills I learned in coding school to make my art page all fancy.
